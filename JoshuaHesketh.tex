\maketitle

\section{Preamble}
Pro-active problem solver specialised in the Java enterprise software stack that has strong beliefs in the test-driven development lifecycle of re-usable software components.
I pride myself on keeping my knowledge base current and skills useful to employers that require secure supportable software solutions that can scale with the incredible demands placed upon global products.\\

I'm responsible, reliable and hold a good work ethic.
I have strong knowledge in enterprise, mobile and web technologies and associated DSLs. The majority of which comes from personal interest solidified by practical commercial experience.

I have a longstanding non-commercial interest in software and hardware security that has increasing become a commercial asset as the financial industry pushes the boundaries in ensuring data integrity is maintained.
